# Project 1: "Big Data EDA: Revealing Insights in Vast Datasets"
- A dataset of 2.3 million US wildfires from 1992 to 2015, created by an independent researcher, is available on Kaggle.
- Python project using pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, folium, and plotly.express for EDA and data visualization.

   * Dataset Selection: Select a large real-world dataset from Kaggle, ensuring its suitability for analysis.
   * ETL: Perform Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations on the dataset, handling its 1 GB size and importing it into the desired environment.
   * Data Cleaning and Preparation: Utilize pandas and numpy to clean and prepare the data, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   * Exploratory Analysis and Visualization: Use matplotlib and seaborn libraries to explore the dataset, visualizing relationships, distributions, and patterns           within the data.
   * Question and Answer in Jupyter Notebook: Analyze and answer specific questions about the dataset, gaining insights into its characteristics and behavior.
   * Summarize Insights: Summarize key insights and draw conclusions from the exploratory analysis.

To enhance the understanding and impact of the project results, the findings and insights are presented below using visualizations, charts, and graphs.
